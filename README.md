# nocTools

**NOC tools for everyone !**

*The idea of this repository is to hold links to different tools I (eventually "we") have tested and developed a tutorial for anyone willing to give it a try !*



## Monitoring Tools

1. [**TIG**](https://65007.github.io/TIG/): Set up monitoring environment using TIG (Telegraf+InfluxDB+Grafana)
2. [**apcupsdMon**](https://65007.github.io/apcupsdMon): Create InfluxDB database to hold data incoming from the server that has the UPS connected and apcupsd running and generate a Grafana dashboard to view it.
